# Titanic-ML
This work highlights how you can use machine learning to predict whether someone will survive or die if they were in the Titanic ship. The Dataset for this project can be obtaoned from Kaggle website at the following link https://www.kaggle.com/rutakara/titanic-dataset/data

## Introduction
Most people have an idea of what happened to the Titanic ship in early 1900's. But for inspiring data scientists, Titanic tragedy present an opportunity to learn machine learning. If you can clean, visualize, perform feature engineering and eventually develop a machine learning model to predict if someone would have lived or died in the Titanic ship, then it's like outputting "hello world" from your first programming code in undergrad.

## Content
Titanic dataset includes the following fields or variables PassengerID: The ID of each passenger in who was in the Titanic ship Survived: If an individual survived, is represented by 1, otherwise, 0 for dead Pclass: there were 3 classes in the ship, i.e. 1st, 2nd and 3rd Name Name of the passenger Sex representing the gender of each passenger Age age of the passenger SibSp indicating the number of sibling for each passenger, if any Parch parents Ticket ticket number Fare fare paid by each passenger in USD currency Cabin indicates the name of the cabin where each passenger was assigned to Emberked there were 3 port

## Acknowledgements
Data science dojo have given me good introduction to machine learning. I owe to them for the good foundation. This is my first attempt in doing machine learning after months and months of online self studies. I welcome you to go through this work and comment whenever you can. For those are new in machine learning, I will be glad to provide answers to whatever questions they have on my work

##Inspiration
We can all make the world a better place if we all maximise our circle of influence. For other fields, one does not have opportunity to real make a mark. But for data scientists, the circle of influence can get as big as one wishes it to be. Data science can be used in every field today! This is what makes data science so powerful and so amazing. I have good background in scientific computing and mathematics. For the longest time I felt like this background will never be used in this lifetime. Now, I am over the moon working on data science problems. Real happy. If I can use data science to do good or change our way of life for the better, while I enjoy what I am doing... then there can be nothing out there that can be as fulfilling as data science :sparkles:
